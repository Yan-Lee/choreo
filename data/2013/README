There are two types of files here:

temporal-xxx.dat
topo-xxx.dat

In both cases, xxx = seconds since epoch when measurements were
started.  The first line of both files is of the form
    instance_type=<EC2 instance type>

temporal*.dat files contain lines of the form:
    src dst time_of_measurement tput

topo*.dat files contain lines of the form
    src dst path_length tput

In both cases, throughput was measured via netperf.  path_length was
measured via traceroute.

The make_2013_*.py graphs will make the various CDFs in the paper.
They require gnuplot and epstopdf to make the actual graphs, but you
can comment that out if you'd just like to see the CDFs.
