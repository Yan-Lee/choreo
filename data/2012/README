Files are named as xxx.dat, where xxx = seconds since epoch during the
time when the measurements were started.

Each file has entries of the form:

src dst path_length throughput

path_length was measured via traceroute.
throughput was measured via netperf.

The directories correspond to the availability zone of EC2 that was
measured.

To create fig 1 from the paper, run:
> python make_2012_cdf.py

This script requires gnuplot and epstopdf.  It does nothing more than
create CDFs of the data.  In fact, it ignores the src, dst, and
path_length fields of every file.
